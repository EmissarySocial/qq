## An Overly Simplistic Message Queue

QQ (Queue of Queues) is a message queue with as few moving parts as possible.  It is being developed initially for handling outbound HTTP requests for the [Emissary project](https://github.com/EmissarySocial/emissary) with the hope that this style of message queue may be useful for other projects in the future.

QQ supports a wide variety of workloads, with is main feature being that messages in each channel are delivered sequentially, and that failed message deliveries in any particular channel will block subsequent messages in that same channel but will not block other channels.  However, messages to different channels (typically to different external servers) may be delivered out of order.

QQ is not a high-performance, high-throughput message queue, as there are plenty of more rigorous message queues out there for this purpose.  Instead, it is made to be simple to use and install, with as few external dependencies as possible.  This initial version supports MongoDB, but QQ should be easy to port to other NoSQL databases, and I'll be happy to help anyone who's interested in undertaking this task.

## A Queue of Queues

A "Queue of Queues" means that QQ stores tasks in a two dimensional array.  The first dimension holds "channels" which represent tasks that are all waiting to be sent to a particular destination, for instance outbound HTTP messages that are all being sent to the same server domain.  This is different from the actual message handler -- there might be many kinds of messages going to the same domain, each processed by related-but-different message handlers.

The second dimension in the Queue of Queues contains the actual tasks themselves.  These stack up in chronological order so that all messages are delivered to their destination server in the order that they are sent.  This behavior is valuable for replaying transaction histories (such as ActivityPub messages) where the order of operations might matter.

QQ processes messages by starting with the oldest channel in its queue, then processing each of the tasks in that queue in order, up to a maximum number.  The queue's processing date is reset, and QQ moves on to the next channel.  If number of messages in the channel exceeds the maximum, then the rest will be processed when the channel bubbles back to the top of its Queue.

In practice, QQ will have many workers running simultaneously (configurable, of course) so many channels will be active at the same time.

## Error Handling
Another important behavior of QQ is built into its odd data structure.  In event of an error -- for instance, if the remote HTTP server is offline -- then all of the outbound messages in that channel will be held.  QQ uses a configurable exponential backoff algorithm to wait until the remote server is available again, then all of the outbound messages will be replayed in order.  This prevents [the "thundering herd" problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thundering_herd_problem) that often plagues distributed systems.


## Using QQ

```go

func main() {
	queue := qqmongo.New("mongodb://server.name/connection/string", qq.WithWorkerCount(128))
	queue.Start()
}
```
